# homemadefood
This project is an individual project for my database class. The goal of this project is to show my understanding of EER model and relational schema.
I decided to buil a full stack applcation that enables users to browse, comment, and order home-made food. 
This project is coded in Python3.
## Getting Started
### Pre-requisites and Local Development
You should already have Python3, pip, node, sqlite3 installed on your local machines
To create a virtual environment on MacOS, run:
```python3 -m venv env```
To activate the virtual environment, run:
```source env/bin/activate```
## About the Stack
### Backend
On MacOS, to set up all the dependencies, run:
```pip install requirements.txt```
To run the application on your local machine, run:
```export FLASK_APP=main.py ```
### Frontend
Installing dependencies, run:
```npm install```
To run the front-end, run:
```npm start ```
## Files that are written by me:
- data.sql

- main.py
- All files in homemadefood > src > components
- App.js
- Credit: I used some templates from material-ui to display tables, menu bar, buttons, etc. in my front end (Link: https://material-ui.com/). I modified the template to work with my data returned by my back-end, and also modified it according to my design purposes.
